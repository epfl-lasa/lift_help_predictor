# lift_help_predictor documentation
### Algorithm  
The purpose of these scripts is to perform data manipulations that can later train a learning algorithm. Included is a brief, high-level discussion about how algorithm may work. See [algorithm.md](./algorithm.md)

### Code 
Other files in this folder explain the code in three parts: 

##### 1. Recording
Scripts are included to record OptiTrack motion capture and RGB camera data. See [recording.md](./recording.md) for further details.   

##### 2. Parsing 
Scripts are included to parse each recording to a .csv file containing only joint and object positions for each recording. See [parsing.md](./parsing.md) for more. 

##### 3. Visualizing 
 Scripts are included to see animations and plots of the recorded data, just as seen in the demo. See [visualization.md](./visualization.md) for more.
